# Named-entity-extraction-with-Spacy

The goal of this project is to build a customized NER model using Spacy to extract domain-specific keywords, particularly the store number, from transaction descriptors.

To achieve this, we first gathered a dataset of transaction descriptors and manually labeled the store numbers using the Spacy format. We then trained the NER model using this dataset and evaluated its performance.

The resulting model was able to accurately extract store numbers from new transaction descriptors with a high level of precision. This tool could be useful for businesses looking to extract important information from large amounts of transaction data.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of using customized NER models in combination with tools like Spacy to extract valuable insights from unstructured data in a variety of domains.
